## Asteroid Radar

Asteroid Radar is an app to view the asteroids detected by NASA that pass near Earth, you can view all the detected asteroids given a period of time with data such as the size, velocity, distance to earth and if they are potentially hazardous.

The resulting output of the project is two screens: a Main screen with a list of all the detected asteroids and a Details screen that displays the data of that asteroid once it´s selected in the Main screen list. The main screen also shows the NASA image of the day to make the app more striking.

* NOTE: In order for this project to pull data, you will need to add your API Key to the project as a value in Constants.
* You will need the NEoWs API which is a free, open source API provided by NASA JPL Asteroid team, as they explain it: “Is a RESTful web service for near earth Asteroid information. With NeoWs a user can: search for Asteroids based on their closest approach date to Earth, lookup a specific Asteroid with its NASA JPL small body id, as well as browse the overall data-set.”  
* You can generate an API Key from https://api.nasa.gov/
